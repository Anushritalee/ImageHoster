# ImageHoster

Image Hoster is an assignment aiming to build an image hoster similar to [Imgur](https://imgur.com/), one of the top 100 most visited websites in the world.

## Goals of This Assignment 
Through working on the image uploader, we are getting an opportunity to experience what it is like to join an engineering team as a new, junior software engineer. Specifically, we will familiarize ourself with the codebase by fixing a few bugs in the codebase. We will also get a chance to implement a few well-defined features to the image uploader and improve its functionalities.

Lastly, this project will also introduce us to new concepts to [Spring MVC](https://spring.io/guides/gs/serving-web-content/) , [JPA](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing#:~:text=Unit%20tests%20are%20typically%20automated,an%20individual%20function%20or%20procedure.).
